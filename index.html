                <h3><b>Plato</b></h3>
                <p>Plato was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. Plato is also considered the founder
                of Western political philosophy. His most famous contribution is the theory of Forms known by pure reason, in which
                Plato presents a solution to the problem of universals known as Platonism (also ambiguously called either Platonic
                realism or Platonic idealism).</p>

                <p>Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend, but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a gem-engraver on the
                island of Samos. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that,
                around 530 BC, he travelled to Croton in southern Italy, where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to
                secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle.</p>

                <p>An enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing after
                his lifetime, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. Aristophanes, a playwright, is the main contemporary author to have written plays
                mentioning Socrates during Socrates' lifetime, though a fragment of Ion of Chios' Travel Journal provides important
                information about Socrates' youth.</p>

            <p class="hero">For much of its history, Athens was either preparing for war, at war, or recovering from war. But in the window between
            the Persian and Peloponnesian Wars, from 454 to 430 B.C., the city was at peace, and it flourished. The Athenians were
            “not very numerous, not very powerful, not very organized,” as the classicist Humphrey Kito noted, but they nevertheless
            “had a totally new conception of what human life was for, and showed for the first time what the human mind was for.”</p>

            <p>Despite the tight historical links between science and philosophy, present-day scientists often perceive philosophy as
            completely different from, and even antagonistic to, science. We argue here that, to the contrary, philosophy can have
            an important and productive impact on science.

            Across the millennia, the voices of the Greek philosophers have been shaping our minds, our institutions, our leaders
            and our civilization as a whole. These Greek thinkers have unquestionably proved that the same problem can be approached
            in different ways, that common sense is not as common as we like to believe, that considering unfamiliar possibilities
            can enlarge our thought and that imagination and ideas can be immortal.</p>
