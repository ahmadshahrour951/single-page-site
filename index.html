                <h3><b>Plato</b></h3>
                <p>Plato was the innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy. Plato is also considered the founder
                of Western political philosophy. His most famous contribution is the theory of Forms known by pure reason, in which
                Plato presents a solution to the problem of universals known as Platonism (also ambiguously called either Platonic
                realism or Platonic idealism).</p>

                <h3><b>Pythagoras</b></h3>
                <p>Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend, but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a gem-engraver on the
                island of Samos. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that,
                around 530 BC, he travelled to Croton in southern Italy, where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to
                secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle.</p>

                <h3><b>Socrates</b></h3>
                <p>An enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing after
                his lifetime, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. Aristophanes, a playwright, is the main contemporary author to have written plays
                mentioning Socrates during Socrates' lifetime, though a fragment of Ion of Chios' Travel Journal provides important
                information about Socrates' youth.</p>
